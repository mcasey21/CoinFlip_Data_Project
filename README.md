# COINFLIP DATA PROJECT

this project has 3 modes:
- you vs computer
- you vs friend
- data & analytics mode

The analytics mode is the star of the show here. It follows 2 strats to see which one wins more; picking tails only & random picks 

To check which strat works better 2 graphs are made using matplotlib
The graphs show the amount of wins, losses and draws after 100 tries
